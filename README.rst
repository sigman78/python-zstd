Python bindings to Yann Collet ZSTD compression library

**Zstd**, short for Zstandard, is a new lossless compression algorithm, which provides both good compression ratio _and_ speed for your standard compression needs. "Standard" translates into everyday situations which neither look for highest possible ratio (which LZMA and ZPAQ cover) nor extreme speeds (which LZ4 covers).

It is provided as a BSD-license package, hosted on [Github https://github.com/Cyan4973/zstd].
